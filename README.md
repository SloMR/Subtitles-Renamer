# Subtitles-Renamer

## Description

This shell script is designed to rename all subtitle files in a specified folder to include a language code in their names. This feature is particularly useful when organizing movies or videos with subtitles in multiple languages. The script checks for files with specific extensions (`.srt` and `.ass`) and renames them to include the provided language code as a suffix.

## Usage/Examples

<img src="./Examples/1.png" alt="Example 1" width="300"/>
&nbsp;
<img src="./Examples/2.png" alt="Example 2" width="300"/>

&nbsp;
```shell script
chomd +x ./arabic_converter.sh
```

To make the script executable.

```shell script
./rename_subtitle.sh <language> <folder_path>
```

Replace `<language>` with the language code (e.g., "ar" for Arabic) and `<folder_path>` with the path to the folder containing the files you want to rename. For example:

```shell script
./rename_subtitle.sh ar /Movies/MyMovie
```

Note: The script assumes that the `mv` command is available on your system. If it's not installed or you encounter any issues, please ensure that the command is properly installed and configured before running the script.

## Options
The script requires two positional arguments:

1 - `<language>`: The language code to be added as a suffix to the files' names (e.g., "ar" for Arabic).

2 - `<folder_path>`: The path to the folder containing the files you want to rename.


&nbsp;
## Behavior

1 - The script checks if the correct number of arguments is provided. If not, it displays the usage instructions.

2 - The `check_rename()` function is responsible for the main functionality of the script. It renames all `.srt` and `.ass` files in the specified folder that do not already contain the provided language code in their names.

3 - Before renaming the files, the script checks if the provided folder path exists and is a valid directory.

4 - If any of the checks fail or if the user does not provide the correct arguments, an error message is displayed, and the script exits with an exit code of 1.

5 - If the folder and language code checks pass, the script proceeds to rename the files using the `mv` command.

6 - The script searches for files with the `.srt` and `.ass` extensions in the specified folder and its subdirectories.

7 - If a file's name does not already contain the provided language code as a suffix, the script renames the file, adding the language code as a suffix in the format `MyMovie.ar.srt` for Arabic subtitles.

8 - The renaming operation uses `echo_then_run()` function to print the command being executed and then actually run it. If you want to test the script without renaming the files, you can uncomment the `echo "$@"` line inside the `echo_then_run()` function.

&nbsp;
## Error Handling

- If the user does not provide the correct number of arguments or any of the provided arguments are empty, the script will display an error message and exit with a status code of 1.

- If the provided folder path does not exist or is not a valid directory, the script will display an error message and exit with a status code of 1.

&nbsp;
## Notes

- This script is specifically designed to rename subtitle files with the `.srt` and `.ass` extensions. If you want to rename files with different extensions or handle other types of files, you may need to modify the script accordingly.

- The script uses the `-u` option in the shebang `(#!/bin/bash)` to exit immediately if any command returns a non-zero status (set -e). It also uses the `-e` option to treat unset variables as an error. Additionally, it uses `set -o pipefail` to propagate the exit status of the last command that returned a non-zero status in a pipeline. These options enhance the script's safety and reliability.

- Please make sure to test the script on a small subset of your files before running it on a large dataset to ensure it behaves as expected.
